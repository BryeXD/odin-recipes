Hello! My name is Ryan and this is my very own recipe site!
The purpose of this site is to act as a library for all of my favorite recipes!
I will also demostrate my skills in writing and reading HTML code when creating this project. Thank you for reading!
NOTE : I do not claim ownership for any of these recipes. All credit goes to the original authors.

TODO : Add target="_blank" to img source on all recipe pages
