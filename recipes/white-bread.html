    <h4><u>Description</u></h4>
        <p><em>A delicous white bread perfect for sandwiches and just about everything else!</em></p>
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seven cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>Three cups of water</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of instant yeast <em>(two packets)</em></li>
        <li>Three teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of oil <em>(vegetable, canola, and olive oil will all work fine)</em></li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of salted butter</li>
        <li>A stick of salted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Equipment</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oven</li>
        <li>Standmixer with dough hook  <em>(optional but highly recommended)</em></li>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li> 
        <li>Two loaf pans</li>
        <li>Microwave</li>
        <li>Silicone basting brush</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Recipe</u></h2>
    <p><em><strong>Yields two loaves of bread</strong></em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Estimated time : 3 hours</strong></em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add lukewarm water to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add yeast to the water and mix until yeast dissolves.</li>
        <li>Let sit for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and oil to the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix until it is a doughy consistency <em>(use a standmixer on low with dough hook if you have one).</em></li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a well floured board and knead for eight minutes <em>(this step can get messy as the dough will stick to your hands).</em></li>
        <li>Form dough into a ball shape, cover with a clean towel, and let rest for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the ball over and flatten it out.</li>
        <li>Start to shape the dough into a ball by grabbing an end, and folding it over.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour on top of the ball of dough, cover again with a clean towel, and let rest for one hour.</li>
        <li>Remove towel and flatten dough ball into a pancake like shape. Cut down the middle to make two even pieces of dough.</li>
        <li>Preshape your loaves by folding one end of the dough almost halfway lengthwise, and the other end completely over it. </li>
        <li>Knead until it is in a ball shape. Sprinkle a pinch of flour on top when done.</li>
        <li>Repeat for other half of the dough.</li>
        <li>Cover both with a clean towel and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While it rests, grease your loaf pans with a stick of butter.</li>
        <li>Flatten the ball of dough and fold one end at an angle.</li>
        <li>Fold opposite end over the just folded end. It should be a triangle like shape.</li>
        <li>Take smallest end and roll it over itself into a loaf-like shape. Pinch the end into the loaf so it is seamless.</li>
        <li>Rub a sprinkle of flour onto the dough until it is evenly covered.</li>
        <li>Place the dough into the loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Repeat for other dough piece.</li>
        <li>Cover both loaf pans with a clean towel and let rest for one hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes, but start checking at 35 in case they finish early.</li>
        <li>Take bread out of oven and transfer onto wire rack.</li>
        <li>Brush top of bread with melted butter from microwave.</li>
        <li>For best results, don't cut into the bread until the next day.</li>
